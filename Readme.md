#### PROJECT: Gremio Sweepstake

#### TO DO NOW:

- Work out how to handle multiple variables (scores, teams, etc.):
  - One set of data will be static (Teams names, round number)
  - Another set of data will be handled by the server (guessed scores for each game)
  - How to pass components (scores, team names, round number) between pages?
  - Test this with only 2 rounds
- Create one guessing instance that can be added to a user
- After GUESSING PAGE is done, go back to login/register and start issuing JWT and Bcrypting passwords

Later:

- Enhance design of guessing pages

#### THE MISSION:

- Objective:
  A office-type sweepstake app, where users try to guess the results of all of Gremioâ€™s matches in Brasileirao 2023. Correct results and exact matches will yield points. The person with most points will win the sweepstake.

There will be certain stages of implementation:

- DONE - Responsive login page (frontend, backend and database)
- The guessing page - with autosave and a submit button, for all final users to submit.
- Navigation for all users to see all guesses - per match, per user and a results table (which shows who is winning). Results will be pushed by the admin
- Full automation, with results being updated automatically (I will have to either find an API or try to build some sort of scrapper)

#### LATER:

- issue JWT tokens
- persist JWT tokens (refresh tokens)
- create validators for register/login
- handle server errors

#### DONE:

- Start THE GUESSING PAGES
- Recreate page design for guesses (dashboard)
- DONE... Create userSchema for login (fetch user from database)
- DONE... After login, redirect to a simple Dashboard
- Create the layout for the page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQl7BarutoE
- Create react app
- Making a fully responsive login/register page that accepts Google authentication. -> Changed my mind. Look at coding program log

- Learn how to implement Auth0 or Firebase -> Changed my mind. Look at coding program log
