#### PROJECT: Gremio Sweepstake

TO DO NOW:

- DONE... Create userSchema for login (fetch user from database)
- After login, redirect to a simple Dashboard
- Create one guessing instance that can be added to user

LATER:

- issue JWT tokens
- persist JWT tokens (refresh tokens)
- create validators for register/login
- handle server errors
- create "validators" in register/login react, with error message box

#### THE MISSION:

- Objective:
  A office-type sweepstake app, where users try to guess the results of all of Gremioâ€™s matches in Brasileirao 2023. Correct results and exact matches will yield points. The person with most points will win the sweepstake.

There will be certain stages of implementation:

- Responsive login page (frontend, backend and database)
- The guessing page - with autosave and a submit button, for all final users to submit.
- Navigation for all users to see all guesses - per match, per user and a results table (which shows who is winning). Results will be pushed by the admin
- Full automation, with results being updated automatically (I will have to either find an API or try to build some sort of scrapper)

First steps:

- Create the backend for login/register
- Make sure all is working: validators and error handling
- Make a page that each logged user controls.
- NEXT STEP: Build the guessing page.
